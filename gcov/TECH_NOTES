Technical Notes about gcov.php.net
==================================

Paths on the server
-------------------
The Git files are located in /local/Web/sites/php-gcov-web
This directory is not updated automatically to allow manual updates of
stable code only. Remember that breaking the cron scripts is a
terrible thing that most of time will only be discovered one week
later (the time that takes a full build).

The build dir (where the php sources are located) is: /var/php_gcov
This is where the valgrind suppression file lives, where you need to
change the config.nice files (to add/remove extensions) and where the
build logs are saved.

To run a build you to call the /home/nlopess/cronjob script. This
file do some cleanup before calling the cron.sh script and also set
some environment variables. Probably you'll also want to run the
script with the 'nlopess' user, so that you don't run in weird
permission problems.


Master vs client
----------------
We call the master server to the gcov.php.net machine, as it receives
the results from other computers - the clients - and also compiles PHP
on its own.


The cron scripts
----------------
The cron script (cron/cron.sh) updates the Git checkouts, runs
configure and make. Then it calls cron.php with generated log files.
Each php cron script is in a separated file, to follow a plugin-style
architecture. Each script then produces a .inc file that consists of
serialized data. These files are written to the www/PHP_VERSION
directory. They are then read directly by the web interface.
Lcov is also called by the cron.sh script. The html files are then
moved as-is to the www/PHP_VERSION/lcov_html directory.


The web interface
-----------------
The web interface is pretty simple. It just reads the information from
the database (like how much time the last build toke), and also from
the files that were created by the cron scripts.


Submitting results from external machines
----------------------------------------
This feature doesn't currently work. The idea is to adapt the
cron.php file so that it posts the .inc (the serialized data) to the
gcov.php.net server. The server would then store the files in the
www/other_platforms/username folder and generate the graphs.
To make this work few work is needed in the web interface (just
complete the path prefix thing) and do a simple data receiver.
