     1. Track -STABLE: cd /usr/src && cvsup stable-supfile
    
     2. Read and understand /usr/src/UPDATING.

     3. Run mergemaster; this should be done by experienced
        personnel only. 

     4. If mergemaster did not update /dev, run 
     
        cd /dev && sh MAKDEV all
    
     5. Ensure that /etc/make.conf does not build unnecessary stuff
        (such as Fortran, Objective C, sendmail, profiling libraries)

     6. Verify that fsck_y_enable="YES" is defined in /etc/rc.conf.
        Otherwise, fsck might wait for console input and halt the
        boot process.

     7. Verify that the kernel config file is up to date and that 
        no new requirements were added which have not been met
        yet (refer to UPDATING).

        Constraints:
        
        pair1, 11, 12: SMP/APIC_IO can be set; firewall optional.
        pair2: SMP/APIC_IO MUST NOT be set; firewall MUST be set.

        Ensure that SMP and APIC_IO are only set, if the machine has
        multiple processors.  A SMP kernel will not boot on an UP
        machine. "sysctl hw.ncpu" will tell you the number of CPUs.

     8. Clean up:
     
        rm -rf /usr/obj
        
     9. nohup make buildworld -jX &

        where X is <number of cpus + 1>

    10. make buildkernel installkernel KERNCONF=NEWPB1 

        Adapt kernel config name as necessary.

    11. Take a snapshot of the running processes/services:

        ps ax > /root/pslist-old
    
    12. Reboot.

    13. make installworld

    14. Reboot.

    15. Compare the current process list with the saved one.  Ensure
        that all services which ran before are running now.
