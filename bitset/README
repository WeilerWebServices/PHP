BITSET
Released under the PHP License 3.01

The BitSet library assists by providing a mechanism to manage sets of bits. This 
provides a similar API (object-based) to java.util.BitSet with some PHP-specific 
flavoring. 

The original functions provided under 1.0 are still available, though deprecated 
as of 2.0 and will be removed under 3.0.
