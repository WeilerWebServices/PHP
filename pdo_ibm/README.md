## How to install php pdo_ibm extension in Linux/Mac
```
if IBM_DB_HOME and LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable not set then set them with installed CLIDRIVER.
(say CLIDRIVER installed at "/home/user/clidriver")

export IBM_DB_HOME=/home/user/clidriver 
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/clidriver/lib

1) pecl install pdo_ibm
        
2) Open the php.ini file in an editor of your choice. Edit the extension entry in the
   php.ini file in the <local_php_directory>/php/lib directory to reference the PHP driver:
       extension=pdo_ibm.so
       
3) Ensure that the PHP driver can access the libdb2.so CLI driver file by
   setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable for Linux and UNIX operating systems
   other than the AIXÂ® operating system. For AIX operating system, you must set LIBPATH variable. 

4) Optional: If the PHP application that is connecting to an IBM database server is running ini
   the HTTP server environment, add the LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable in the httpd.conf file.
