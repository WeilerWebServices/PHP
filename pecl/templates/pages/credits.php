<h2>Credits</h2>

<p>
All credit goes to everyone who has submitted and/or commented on a bug report,
written documentation, submitted a user note, created and/or maintained a PECL
extension, worked on this website, been involved with the mailing lists or IRC,
worked on PHP internals, PEAR, and much much more. Basically, the credit goes to
everyone who has helped make PHP better because everything here is tied together.
Specific names are available within each PECL package but there are also the
countless number of people who work on this project every day, people who spend
large amounts of available free time to help make PHP the best it can be.
