Whenever you notice that news is slow, you can go through this process
to 'resolve' that issue.

   -- Login and su/sudo on lists.php.net

   cd /var/log/news
   cat current | cut -d " " -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

   or, if you want to look over time:

   cat current \@4* | cut -d " " -f1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n

For each IP you see who are clearly using more than others, then you
should perform the following steps, as root (environment sets cvs vars):

	$EDITOR /local/bin/systems/news-denied

	<add the offending ip to the list>
	
	sh /local/bin/systems/nntp-spambots
	
	cvs commit -m "updating news spambot list" /local/bin/systems/news-denied


Alternatively, you can firewall them from the server by:

    ipfw add deny tcp from <ip> to any

But be aware that this is not pervasive across reboots.

if you need to remove something from the ipfw list, then use ipfw list
and ipfw delete <rule number>

Also, please don't block pb2 which is IP 216.92.131.4.  This needs
to always get access. You probably only need to firewall out the
clients who are pulling over 1000 hits -- these are likely to be robots
who are indexing the nntp server, probably for the purpose of
