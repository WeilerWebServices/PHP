This is the configuration for our monitoring setup.

NAGIOS
------

* Make sure that nagios/hosts.cfg is symlinked to whatever Nagios uses
  for its configuration. Most likely this is some variant of
  /local/nagios-x.y.z/etc/hosts.cfg.

MUNIN
-----

* munin.conf must be symlinked to /etc/munin/munin.conf.
