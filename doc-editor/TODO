GENERAL:
========

* Dedicate a wiki page to the doc-editor (and move this TODO there)
* Take a decision once and for all about the app name, and its spelling
* Take a decision about the license, and update all the files accordingly
* Allow use for other systems
  - Other PHP Projects (peardoc, gtkdocs, php-src/README*, phpweb/reST/)
  - Other VCS Systems (SVN, GIT)
  - Generic projects (not php.net related)

PHP:
====

* Security
  - Fix XSS holes
  - Redo the folder tree to keep classes and data out of web server reach (can we do this in mod_rewrite?)

JAVASCRIPT:
===========

* Implement RTL where appropriate

USER INTERFACE:
===============

* Main Interface
  - Get rid of the "Main Menu" and put the buttons on the header

* Add support and tools for specific markup types
  - DocBook
  - ReST
  - PO files (gettext)

* Implement WYSIWYG
  - using XSLT for rendering? (inspired by http://beacon.kix.in/)
