Archive my old, unmaintained version of Runkit

If you like runkit and want to make use of it, checkout https://github.com/zenovich/runkit They're actually maintaining the project and you'll have a better experience for it.

If, for some reason, you need the last version that was here, fear not.

Revision control remembers.
$ git checkout last-sgolemon-version

A backup of this repo will remain at https://github.com/sgolemon/archive-runkit

Cheers!
