; This file is supposed to describe some specialities of the dependency libs.
; The available options are:
;
; expand_include=    Whether subdirs in the includes of this lib have to be added to the path.
;                    Usually no header clashing happens, so if not set, default is true. Set
;                    explicitly to zero if you don't want it.
