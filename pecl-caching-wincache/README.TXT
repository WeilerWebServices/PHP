ETW Tracing & Manifest file:
----------------------------

As of May 26, 2015, there is no mechanism to have the Win32 build environment
call the $(MC) command with the right parameters against the ETW Manifest file.
So, if you make changes to the ETW manifest file, you'll need to hand-execute
the $(MC) command with the right parameters, and check in the changed files.

Command to execute (in the pecl\wincache directory):
  mc -um -e h -h .\ -r .\ wincache_etw.man

Files generated by 'mc':
  wincache_etw.h
  wincache_etw.rc
  MSG00001.bin
  wincache_etwTEMP.BIN

To register the manifest, open an admin cmd window, and execute the following
command:
  wevtutil im wincache_etw.man

If you've previously registered a manifest, you'll have to unregister the
manifest, and then re-register it.
  wevtutil um wincache_etw.man
  wevtutil im wincache_etw.man

To capture ETW traces, you can create a log profile with logman:

  logman create trace wincache_etw -p "{F7AD0093-D5C3-46B9-BEEA-A9FCEC7E1408}" -o c:\temp\wincache_etw
  logman start wincache_etw
  <...do your repro...>
  logman stop wincache_etw
  tracerpt wincache_etw_000001.etl -import wincache_etw.man

You'll need to copy the wincache_etw.man to the machine where you're executing
wincache, and wherever you're running tracerpt.exe.
