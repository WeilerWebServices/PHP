You will need either a custom authentification module or a working "users.auth.php"
in "dw/conf/users.auth.php". A normal dokuwiki install will generate one using the
credentials you used during the install.

To use the CVS authtentification module, an environment variable is required, its
name is "dokuwikitoken". See the sample lighttpd.conf for an example (or use
SetEnv in Apache). Ask Hannes (bjori@php.net) for the current valid plain text
token.

Apache users might prefer setting up the mod_rewrite via a .htaccess file. See
the dokuwiki documentation for a sample .htaccess file:

There is no data in cvs. The data is only available on the server and backup many
times daily. If you need sample data using the production documents, please contact
the php webmaster list.
