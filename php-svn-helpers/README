            Checkout scripts for PHP's github mirror
-----------------------------------------------------------------------            

1. Purpose
 PHP's version control system of choice is subversion, but we offer official
 git mirrors at github.com. These mirrors were imported using git-svn.
 If you want to use git and particularly git-svn to interact with PHP's subversion
 repository we strongly recommend to use the github mirror intead of cloning
 the svn.php.net directly.
 
 The scripts provided in this repository will help you to clone the repositories
 from github and reinitialize the metadata so that you can commit back to the svn
 repository.
 
2. Usage
 To checkout the complete php-src tree containing PHP's source code and the Zend
 Engine use the checkout-tree.sh shell script. An example would be:
 
  $ checkout-tree php-src.git git://github.com/php/php-src
 
 which will checkout the php-src repository at github into the php-src.git repository
 and reinitialize the subversion metadata.
 
 To checkout out a particular branch of the repository you can use the checkout-branch
 script:
  
  $ checkout-branch php-5.3.git PHP_5_3 git://github.com/php/php-src
 
3. Licensing
 I don't care about the license, consider the stuff being licensed under the MIT License,
 but you might buy me a beer if we meet.
