This file is only to be used if there is a translation of the
GNU Free Documentation License available.  (The English version
of the license has legal authority in all cases.)  If you are
intending to provide such a translation, you will need to id
this file as <appendix id="translicense"> and give it the title
&TransLicense; (see language-defs.ent in your language directory). 
The XML should otherwise match that of the original English License,
which resides in the toplevel php-gtk-doc directory and which must
NOT be touched!

You may want to link to the translated version alongside the original
license from bookinfo.xml (also in the language directory) - for this
you will need to use <link linkend="translicense">&TransLicense;</link>.
