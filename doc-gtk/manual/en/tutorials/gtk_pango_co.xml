   When programming PHP-GTK applications and surfing through the manual, you
   will find some rather cryptic acronyms. Here is an overview of the more
   important ones.

   <title>PHP</title>
   <simpara>
    PHP - PHP: Hypertext Processor - is a widely-used general-purpose scripting
    language that is designed for Web development and can be embedded into HTML.

   <title>GTK</title>
   <simpara>
    GTK - the GIMP Tool Kit - is a library designed for creating graphical
    user interfaces. It runs on most UNIX-like platforms, on Windows, and on
    framebuffer devices.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    The GTK library itself contains widgets, that is, GUI components, such
    as <classname>GtkButton</classname> or <classname>GtkTextView</classname>.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    GTK depends on several other libraries, among them GDK, Pango, ATK and
    GLib. The combined package is referred to as GTK+.

   <title>GDK</title>
   <simpara>
    GDK - the GIMP Drawing Kit - is the abstraction layer that allows GTK+ to
    support multiple windowing systems. GDK provides drawing and window system
    facilities for X11, Windows, and the Linux framebuffer device.

   <title>Pango</title>
   <simpara>
    Pango is a library for internationalized text handling. It centers around
    the <classname>PangoLayout</classname> object, which represents a
    paragraph of text. Pango provides the engine for
    <classname>GtkTextView</classname>, <classname>GtkLabel</classname>,
    <classname>GtkEntry</classname>, and other GTK+ widgets that display text.

   <title>ATK</title>
   <simpara>
    ATK is the Accessibility Tool Kit. It provides a set of generic interfaces
    allowing accessibility technologies to interact with a graphical user
    interface. For example, a screen reader could use ATK to discover the text
    in an interface and read it to blind users.
   </simpara>
   <simpara>
    Thanks to the ATK framework, GTK+ widgets have built-in support for
    accessibility.
