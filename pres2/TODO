Things to work on

- This thing probably needs a name

- Calling all ming hackers - help us with some cool transitions for the navbar
  and also the various individual slide components if people choose to use
  the flash version.

- We also need to pretty up the navbar flash widget.  All sorts of slick
  things could be done in this thing.

- A cooler help page would be nice.

- Someone want to pretty up slidelist.php?

- Perhaps a pop-up widget to change $baseFontSize on the fly?  The base font
  size that works on one machine may not work at all on another.  So a quick
  way to change it would be cool.  The nice thing about the system is that
  everything is relative to the baseFontSize, so there is only one value to
  change.

- Perhaps a set of suggested fonts for various browsers would be a good idea 
  as well.

- make all hard-coded settings (like border padding) configurable on a per-presentation
  basis.	

- Go through each XML tag and make sure the attributes are implemented and 
  consistent across all display modes.  And at the same time, document each
  tag in the intro presentation.

- Add ability to find/view the "Most Recent Talks", perhaps as its own topic,
  likely create a topic named "Most Recent Talks", sort all talks by date, then
  add 20 or so there.
