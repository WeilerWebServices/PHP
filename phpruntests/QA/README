Checking the the output from phpruntests against run-tests.php
==============================================================

1) Extract the file QATESTS.tgz into a directory called (for example) QA.

2) Run the new run tests with flags -o csv against the QA directory, eg run-tests.php -o csv -s phprt_out QA

3) cd to teh QA directory and run all teh tests like this:
php run-tests.php Zend ext sapi tests > rt_out
It's no good trying to run all the tests by just giving run-tests the top level directory name, 
the PDO tests fail if you do.

4) Compare the reulsts using
   php compareNewOld.php phprt_out rt_out QA
